Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made the map on which the game will be played. I am importing a picture to use as the background (in a similar way to the Hurricane Lab), and the ball has been created using turtle. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to code the actual game now, but I am worried it will not be fully done before the deadline. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

In trying to make a basket toss, I realized that I would have to account for the curve of a throw. In the interest of time, as well as the current Fifa World Cup, a soccer game seemed more accessible. This way, there is no need to account for the parabolic curve of throwing an object, and instead the kick can be linear. 

I had some trouble trying to figure out how to position the image as a background for the game. Though it was frustrating, I learned a lot about the different functions within tkinter.
